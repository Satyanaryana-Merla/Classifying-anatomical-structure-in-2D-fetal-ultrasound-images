# Classifying-anatomical-structure-in-2D-fetal-ultrasound-images
A deep learning model was trained on fetal ultrasound images, achieving promising classification results across four anatomical structures. The model was optimized and tested on a separate dataset. The code organized and saved classified images, establishing a robust pipeline for accurate fetal anatomical structure classification.
